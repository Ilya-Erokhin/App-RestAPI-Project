# Task:

Testing an application utilizing a REST API that enables users to interact 
with various items typically found in a shop. Additionally, observed 
Unit, Integration, and System tests, which encompass the core functionality of the application.

## Precondition:
1. Download zip file with existing files: app.py, db, run, models, resources and requirements.txt 
2. Install all requirements from requirements.txt, via command ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` in Terminal
3. Create Virtual Environment (venv) using command ```python3 -m venv venv```
4. Activate venv via command ``venv\Scripts\activate``
5. Launch an app on URL - http://127.0.0.1:5000

- Flask - Microframework

<a name="Risks"></a>
### Possible Risks in Automation

- Lack of documentation and clear technical specifications, which can lead to an error in the operation of a real application
- The total time spent on automation can exceed the total time of manual testing, and be very labor-intensive

<a name="Interval time assessment"></a>
### Interval time assessment (in hours)

- Writing an automation plan: 1 hour;
- Test environment setup: 10 min;
- Writing and debugging autotests: 11 hours;
- Witting the Documentation 2 hors;

**Total: 13 hours 10 min**
